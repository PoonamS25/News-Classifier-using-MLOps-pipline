The news category classification aims to recognize and categorize different news articles based on content/information type. The automatic news classification plays a vital role in processing a massive amount of news content. It can classify and label the news articles by analyzing the content (i.e., extracting feature values) to quickly access what they are interested in, allowing efficient and speedy news dissemination.

This is a supervised machine learning classification model that is able to predict the category of a given news article, a web scraping method that gets the latest news from the online newspapers.

MLOps, Machine learning and Operations is more to production-grade machine learning systems than designing learning algorithms and writing code. Being able to select and design the most optimal architecture for this project is often what bridges the gap between machine learning and operations
In common architectural patterns for MLOps, architectural changes occur at the ML stage as well as the Ops stage, where you can have various development and deployment patterns that depend on the problem and the data.
